# Data Science Virtual Internship at CipherByte

This repository contains the work done as part of the virtual internship program at CipherByte Technologies. The tasks completed during this internship are focused on various aspects of data science including classification, time series analysis, and spam detection.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Iris Classification
In this task, a machine learning model was developed to classify the species of the Iris flower based on its measurements. The dataset used contains measurements for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of three Iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

- **Dataset**: [Iris Dataset]
- **Techniques**: Data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Model Training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest), Model Evaluation.

### 2. Unemployment Rate Analysis
This task involved analyzing the unemployment rate data, particularly focusing on the sharp increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal was to derive insights and visualize trends in the unemployment rate.

- **Dataset**: Unemployment rate data (source not specified)
- **Techniques**: Data cleaning, Time Series Analysis, Visualization.

### 3. Time Series Analysis
The goal of this task was to forecast future values based on historical data using time series models like ARIMA and Prophet. The dataset used contained two columns: DATE and S4248SM144NCEN.

- **Dataset**: Historical time series data
- **Techniques**: ARIMA, Prophet, Model Evaluation (RMSE, MAE), Forecasting.

### 4. Spam Email Detection
In this task, a machine learning model was developed to detect spam emails. The model was trained to classify emails into spam and non-spam categories based on their content.

- **Dataset**: Spam email dataset (source not specified)
- **Techniques**: Text preprocessing, Feature Extraction (TF-IDF), Model Training (Naive Bayes, SVM), Model Evaluation.
